Time Constraints:

1. With more time I would like to have improved the css styling for tablet devices. Mobiles such as IPhone XR are complete but devices such as
an IPad require improvement. 

2. Minor css styling issue caused by the results appearing on the page causing the background to have a minor "jump" effect when the results are shown.
